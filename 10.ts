// PROGRAM NUMBER 1
// Name : Abdul Kabeer
// Date : 22-3-2024

// In this program firstly i stored my name in a variable called person_name and then i firstly transferred
// that name into Lowercase then Uppercase, as there is no pre-defined function for titlecase so i created
// a variable called title_Case and then performed some all different functions to convert my name into
// title case and at last i printed my title case also with console.log() command
let person_Name = "kabeer";
console.log("Lowercase : " + person_Name.toLowerCase());
console.log("Uppercase : " + person_Name.toUpperCase());
let title_Case = person_Name[0].toUpperCase() + person_Name.slice(1).toLowerCase();
console.log("titlecase : " + title_Case);

// PROGRAM NUMBER 2
// Name : Abdul Kabeer
// Date : 22-3-2024

// In this one i printed all of my four functions and i made sure that everytime i print them i get 8 from
// all of them
console.log(7 + 1);
console.log(9 - 1);
console.log(2 * 4);
console.log(16 / 2);
